# Waaree Solar API

Simple, fast, and lightweight API for fetching solar power data from Waaree and Solax solar systems.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Reliable** - Uses full browser for proper authentication
- ✅ **Fast** - Cached responses in <50ms, fresh data in 2-5 seconds
- ✅ **Auto-retry** - Automatic session management and re-login
- ✅ **Secure** - Environment variables for credentials (not hardcoded)
- ✅ **Combined Data** - Supports both Waaree and Solax solar systems

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # or vim, code, etc.
```

Update these required fields:
```bash
PORT=3001
WAAREE_USERNAME=your_username
WAAREE_PASSWORD=your_password
WAAREE_DEVICE_ID=your_device_id
SOLAX_API_URL=your_solax_api_url
```

**How to find your Device ID:**
1. Login to https://digital.waaree.com
2. Navigate to your inverter page
3. Check the URL: `...inverterDetail?id=YOUR_DEVICE_ID&...`
4. Copy the UUID (e.g., `3996d92f-b4e5-490a-b37e-3a617d48077c`)

### 3. Login (One-Time Setup)

```bash
npm run login
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Successfully navigated away from login page
✅ Navigated to dashboard
✅ Device page loaded
⚠️ API test failed: { status: 403 }  ← IGNORE THIS (timing issue)
✅ Saved storage state to: waaree-state.json
   - LocalStorage: Yes

💡 TIP: Session saved successfully!
   To verify: npm run test
```

**Note:** The 403 warning during login is normal. It's just a timing issue where the session needs 10-20 seconds to fully activate on Waaree's servers. The session is still valid!

### 4. Verify Session (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npm run test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Session is VALID and working!
⚡ Power: 1549 Watt
📈 Generation Today: 14.1 kWh
```

### 5. Start Server

```bash
npm start
```

**Output:**
```
✅ Server running on port 3001
📊 Local access: http://localhost:3001
🌐 Public access: http://80.225.207.88:3001

📍 Available endpoints:
   Waaree only: http://80.225.207.88:3001/
   Combined:    http://80.225.207.88:3001/combined
```

### 6. Test API

```bash
# Local
curl http://localhost:3001

# External
curl http://80.225.207.88:3001
```

## 🔐 Session Management

### You DON'T Need to Login Every Time!

The system has **automatic re-login** built-in. You only need to manually login once during initial setup.

**How it works:**

1. **First Time (Once Only):**
   ```bash
   npm run login
   ```
   Creates session file that lasts hours/days

2. **Normal Operation:**
   ```bash
   npm start  # or pm2 start
   ```
   Server uses saved session, no login needed ✅

3. **When Session Expires:**
   - System detects expiration (error 41809)
   - Automatically launches browser in background
   - Logs in using credentials from `.env`
   - Saves new session
   - Continues working
   - **Total downtime:** ~10-15 seconds

**Evidence from server logs:**
```
❌ API returned error: 41809
Session likely expired, attempting auto-login...
🔐 Attempting automatic login...
✅ Successfully navigated away from login page
✅ Auto-login successful, storage saved
Retrying fetch after auto-login...
```

**You don't need to do anything!** Auto-relogin handles everything automatically.

### Session Lifecycle

```
[Manual Login] → [Session Valid] → [Expires] → [Auto-Relogin] → [Session Valid]
     once         hours/days         41809        automatic        continues
```

### When Does Session Expire?

- Typically lasts: **Several hours to days**
- May expire if:
  - Waaree server maintenance
  - Password changed
  - Account accessed from another location

**But you don't care!** Auto-relogin handles it.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Login Phase
- Uses Playwright to automate browser login
- Saves cookies and localStorage to `waaree-state.json`
- Session persists across restarts

### 2. Data Fetching
- Uses full Playwright browser for authentication compatibility
- Makes API calls with saved session through browser context
- Memory usage: ~200-400MB (necessary for Waaree's authentication)

### 3. Caching
- Data cached for 30 minutes
- Auto-refreshes during operating hours (7 AM - 7 PM IST)
- Returns cached data instantly (<50ms)

### 4. Session Management
- Auto-detects session expiration
- Consecutive failure tracking
- Can trigger re-login when needed

## 📊 Performance

| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| **Cached Response** | <50ms |
| **Fresh Fetch** | 2-5 seconds |
| **Combined Endpoint** | 3-8 seconds |

| Resource | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| **Memory** | 200-400MB |
| **Startup Time** | 5-10 seconds |

## 🛠️ Available Commands

```bash
npm run login    # Login and save session

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (never committed)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in source code
- ✅ Session file (`waaree-state.json`) is gitignored
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations

**Best Practices:**
- Keep `.env` file secure (chmod 600)
- Use different credentials for dev/prod
- Never commit `.env` to git
- Rotate passwords regularly

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Login Issues

**Problem:** 403 error after login
```
⚠️ API test failed: { status: 403 }
```

**Solution:** This is normal! The session needs 10-20 seconds to activate on Waaree's servers. Just ignore the warning. The session is saved and works.

To verify: `npm run test` (should pass)

---

**Problem:** "Login may have failed - still on login page"

**Solution:** Check your credentials in `.env`:
```bash
WAAREE_USERNAME=correct_username
WAAREE_PASSWORD=correct_password
```
Then run: `npm run login`

---

**Problem:** Session expired

**Solution:** Re-run login:
```bash
npm run login
```

### Server Issues

**Problem:** Port already in use

**Solution:** Change port in `.env`:
```bash
PORT=3002  # or any available port
```

---

**Problem:** Out of memory on server

**Solution:** The system requires ~200-400MB RAM for proper Waaree authentication. If your server has insufficient memory:

1. Upgrade to at least 1GB RAM
2. Or use a swap file:
```bash
sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

3. Make swap permanent:
```bash
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

---

**Problem:** Cannot access from external IP

**Solution:** Open firewall port:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 3001/tcp
```

And check if process is listening:
```bash
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 3001
```

### API Issues

**Problem:** API returns 503 "Data not available"

**Solution:** Cache is being populated. Wait a few seconds and try again, or run:
```bash
npm run test  # Verify session
npm start     # Restart server
```

---

**Problem:** "Session expired" error in logs

**Solution:** Session has expired. Re-login:
```bash
npm run login
```

Sessions typically last several days but may expire if:
- Password changed
- Account accessed from another location
- Waaree system maintenance

## 🔍 Skip Login Warnings

If you don't want to see the 403 warnings during login:

```bash
SKIP_API_TEST=true npm run login
```

This will skip the API validation test and login cleanly without warnings.

## 📝 Notes

### About the 403 Error During Login

The login script shows a 403 error when testing the API immediately after login. **This is completely normal and expected!**

**Why it happens:**
- Your token is saved to localStorage instantly ✅
- But Waaree's backend needs 10-20 seconds to activate the session ⏳
- Direct API calls fail during this window 🚫
- But the session IS valid and will work ✅

**What to do:**
- Ignore the 403 warnings during `npm run login`
- Optionally run `npm run test` to verify (will pass)
- Or just `npm start` - the API will work perfectly

### Operating Hours

The cache auto-refreshes only during solar operating hours (7 AM - 7 PM IST). Outside these hours, it returns cached data without attempting fresh fetches.

### Memory Usage

The system uses a full browser context (~200-400MB RAM) which is necessary for Waaree's authentication system. The lightweight API doesn't work due to Waaree's session management requirements (error 41809).

**Server Requirements:**
- Minimum: 512MB RAM + 512MB swap
- Recommended: 1GB RAM or more
