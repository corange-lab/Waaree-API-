# Troubleshooting Oracle Cloud Connection Issues

## Current Issue
Security List rule added but still can't access from public IP.

## Checklist to Verify

### 1. Network Security Groups (NSGs)
Oracle Cloud uses **NSGs** which can override Security Lists!

**Check NSGs:**
1. Go to **Networking** → **Network Security Groups**
2. Find NSG attached to your instance
3. Add Ingress Rule:
   - Source: `0.0.0.0/0/0`
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Destination Port: `8888`

### 2. Verify Security List Attachment
1. Go to your VCN → **Subnets**
2. Click on your subnet
3. Check **"Security Lists"** tab
4. Verify your Security List is listed and attached

### 3. Check Instance Details
1. Go to **Compute** → **Instances**
2. Click your instance
3. Check:
   - Has **Public IP**: `144.24.114.26`
   - Subnet has route to Internet Gateway
   - No firewall blocking at instance level

### 4. Route Table
1. **VCN** → **Route Tables**
2. Verify route: `0.0.0.0/0` → Internet Gateway exists

## Quick Test from Server

```bash
# Test locally
curl http://localhost:8888

# Test using public IP from server itself
curl http://144.24.114.26:8888
```

## Alternative: Check Both Security Lists AND NSGs

Oracle Cloud can use:
- **Security Lists** (subnet-level)
- **Network Security Groups** (instance-level) ← Check this!

Both need the rule if NSGs are attached!
